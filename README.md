This is my first personal portfolio website, which I originally developed on my first PC. Unfortunately, that PC no longer starts up, so I decided to redevelop my portfolio. During this process, I started learning Git and discovered how powerful and necessary it is for version control, especially for saving software development projects in a trusted place like a GitHub repository.

Since this is my first portfolio website, I’m reworking it on my new PC. I plan to take it to the next level by using modern tools and frameworks, including:

- React for building the user interface
- Tailwind CSS for styling
- Framer Motion or GSAP for animations
- Appwrite for the backend (still thinking about it)

I’ll be working on this project in June, so stay tuned for updates!
